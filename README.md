# RevertPlayerHeightDetection
Reverts the player height detection algorithm to calculate like it did on 1.13.0.

## Please Read
This is **NOT** recommended.
**ONLY** use this if you used automatic player height detection on Beat Saber 1.13.0. Rather than using this mod, I recommend that you find a height you like, and set it directly via the configuration (`%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Hyperbolic Magnetism\Beat Saber\PlayerData.dat`).

Or... y'know... just get used to the new height detection, as it is correctly calculated now.
